Real Time Attendance Monitoring System
---
- Automating attendance monitoring using Face Recognition.
-  An ESP32-CAM captures facial images, which are processed using a Python-based recognition algorithm.
-   Recognized identities, along with timestamps, are stored in Firebase Firestore, enabling real-time and remote access to 
attendance data.
- A minimal web interface displays records dynamically.
